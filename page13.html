    <h3>(In making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello)</h3>
    <p>
        While making my own website the tools I used for example, Visual Studio Code and Trello, they were really helpful and easy to use and coding with Visual Studio Code was simple enough to organise in their own HTML and CSS files the only real part I struggled with was figuring out the actual code some of it was really easy stuff that needed to be done but i didn’t see it as i should have, but in the end i got it done and thankfully the website is now (almost) finished, Trello helped me organise everything into one place and put them into their own little notes so i could mark off what i’ve finished when i’ve finished it so i could figure out what was left to do and how much there was left to finish the website and actually complete the project.
