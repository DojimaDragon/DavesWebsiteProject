        <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
        <h2>(Unit 1, Outcome 2, 2.3)</h2>
        <h3>are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h3>

            Overall i’m semi-happy with the website, I like parts of the design and I like the background and the style of text, the parts I don’t like and wish I had more time to change are the placements for the next/previous/home buttons, I wish I could find somewhere better to place them that didn’t make them look so out of place, I also wish I had more pictures to add to the site, as the images I have on the homepage are my own images that I made in college over a decade ago, I feel it’s better to use my own images as it’s more personal and as the website is my own personal project I feel it fits more rather than using images I find off google or something similar. I also feel that my technical abilities along with the short time limit i had to complete the website restricted me and made it more difficult to complete it to a completely satisfactory state. I feel if I was given more time and if I had the technical ability I could have done a better job of the website and made it much better than in its current state.
