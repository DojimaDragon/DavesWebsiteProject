    <h3>(How does GDPR impact digital projects)</h3>
    <p>
        GDPR can affect digital projects because it means if you’re creating a user based website you’ll ask the user for permission to use and store their data and they can ask you to remove and delete their stored data at any given time should they want to, so you kind of have to prepare to access the data and delete it if you’re asked to, other ways the GDPR can affect digital projects is by creating legal issues for companies when working with the public. GDPR basically stands for “General Data Protection Regulation” and it applies to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents.”According to the GDPR directive, personal data is any information related to a person such as a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a computer IP address.”[4]
