        <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
        <h2>(Unit 1, Outcome 2, 2.2)</h2>
        <p>
            Visual Studio code was very appropriate for the website building as it was easy to organise them all into the same folder by creating each HTML and CSS file within Visual Studio Code and then creating a seperate folder for the images and referencing them within the code so that the website could show the images that have been referenced within the code and it is all organised into its own file on the desktop meaning it’s easy to find and organise appropriately, Trello was also appropriate because it helped me organise all the work into one simple place and i could mark off what i’d done when i’d done it and then i could move onto the next task and focus on that until it’s done rather than worrying about trying to organise everything myself using some other method for example sticky notes or something, this would have taken a lot of sticky notes and would have taken a lot longer to write out all the sticky notes rather than just typing everything into Trello.
