    <h3>(How do I select the right kind of technology for the job?)</h3>
    <p>The best option for deciding on what tech or software to use for your purposes is to do research into similar jobs people have done, google is your friend for finding information on research and helping you figure out what is best for you to use, you might decide something like Trello could be useful to you for listing all your necessary workload in an itemised fashion so you can mark them off when youâ€™re finished with them and move onto the next one, or you might find something else that does a similar job but maybe even better for your purposes, for example you might have a high number of people in your team and you might want to use colours to highlight which member of your team is working on what, Trello falls down in this aspect as it only has a set amount of colours available and you will run out very fast if you have a team of more than 11 people. Whereas if you research this you can probably find a better option for your large team using google.
