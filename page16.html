    <h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
    <h2>(Unit 1, Outcome 2, 2.4)</h2>
    <p>
        Given enough time and the technical know-how the improvements I feel I could make would be to find a better place for the actual next/previous/home buttons, I could also maybe include more things in the website such as, videos, more images and maybe even some sound or something to make the website a nicer place to visit and potentially improve the website in other ways, such as, making the images clickable to enlarge them to have a look at them in their full size so you can see the images a lot better than the way they are currently shrunk down.
