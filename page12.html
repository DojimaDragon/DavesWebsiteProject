    <h2>Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h2>
    <h2>(Unit 2, Outcome 1, 1.7)</h2>
    <p>
        A website is basically a HTML file, each image or video or whatever you have displayed on your website is just another file but of a different type to each other usually, images come in a range of file types some of the most common image file types for websites are JPEG although the quality of a Jpeg is limited compared to other file types for example a PNG file is usually a better quality of image over a JPEG file, the appropriate file types you need for your website depend on your needs and also depend on if you want quality over file size, as JPEGs generally tend to be a smaller file size compared to a file like a PNG but some JPEGs can also be pretty big in size for an image file.[7]
