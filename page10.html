    <h2>Describe    copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
    <h2>(Unit 2, Outcome 1, 1.5)</h2>
    <p>
        Copyright can affect a company’s website as the fact they might not own the copyright to something they want posted on their website so they would have to ask or potentially pay to use the copyrighted material on their own website, they could also not own the copyright to the website unless the website was created by company employees as part of their regular job, but if they hired somebody to create a website for them then they would have to use “work for hire agreements” or “agreements transferring the copyrightable content to the company you would require a lawyer to do this. But if you yourself are a website designer, you will own the copyright to the copyrightable portions of the designs and content of the website unless you have signed an agreement transferring those rights to someone else.[5]
