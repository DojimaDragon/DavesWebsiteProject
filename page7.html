    <h3>(How has trello helped me plan and how can Github help with my codes version control)</h3>
    <p>
        Trello has helped me plan by putting everything I need to do into individual tabs and leaving notes on them with helpful hints and i can add them to my finished list as and when theyâ€™re done so i know exactly what i have left to do and what i have actually managed to finish so far.
        Github has helped in having somewhere to store my code and giving me somewhere to share my code with other people and people being able to offer help and opinions on where to take my code next and how to correct any errors in my code. Githubs version control can be handy as it allows multiple people to work on the same project without interfering with each others work and share what they have done as and when they want to.
