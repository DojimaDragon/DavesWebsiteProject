    <h3>(Describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them)</h3>
    <p>
        People who suffer with visual impairment require a screen reader for using the internet, therefore websites need to be laid out so the screen reader can actually read the website and read it in the correct order, so laying out a website is important for the visually impaired so that they get the correct information they’re after in the correct order, some screen readers can read HTML and some use the CSS of a website to read what’s on it therefore laying it out correctly and ensuring that the website is readable for those with disabilities is important otherwise they will not understand why the information they’re trying to get from the website is in a confusing and wrong order for what it’s actually supposed to be.
        Also using proper headings for your websites is important for the visually impaired so they can scan the website using the headings and find the article they are looking for easier than just reading the entire page just to find what they’re actually looking for.[6]
