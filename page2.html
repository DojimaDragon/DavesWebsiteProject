    <h2>The purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
    <h2>(Unit 1, Outcome 1, 1.1)</h2>
    <p>
        IT is important in modern business as it can speed up communication, data processing and market intelligence. IT also plays an important role in business by helping companies improve on their business processes, achieve cost efficiencies, increase revenue growth and maintain an advantage in the marketplace.
        IT can also decrease the time it takes for new products to hit the market. Companies can also make product requirement documents by gathering market intelligence from databases and customers. Computer assisted design and manufacturing programs speed up the time it takes to make decisions while collaborative technologies allow teams from various places of the world to work on different components of a product together.
        From innovations in microprocessors to efficient delivery systems, IT helps businesses quickly respond to changing customer requirements.[1]

        For many corporations, email is the principal source of communication between staff, suppliers and customers. Over the years many other communicational tools have evolved and developed allowing staff to communicate using live chat, online meeting tools and video-conferencing systems. VOIP telephones and smart-phones offer even more high-tech communicational technologies for employees.[2]
