    <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
    <h2>(Unit 1, Outcome 3, 3.4)</h2>
     <p>
        Basically I tested my website by opening the HTML document in my browser and clicking on the links and ensuring that everything worked for example, the next/previous/home buttons, the links to references, and also checked that the images were displaying correctly in the browser, I would also make sure that everything is appearing as i wanted it to in the browser so i know the code is doing the job it’s supposed to. I would also test my code using the browser to ensure i’ve entered the code correctly and it functions as it should within the browser itself.
