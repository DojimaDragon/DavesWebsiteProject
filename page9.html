    <h2>Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
    <h2>(Unit 2, Outcome 1, 1.1)</h2>
    <p>
        The index.html(home page) contains pictures of 3D models i did in college over 10 years ago, it also has the about me (unit 1, outcome 1, 1.0) information that was requested for that part of the assignment, it also has a next button for switching to the next page to get more information for the assignment, page2 contains the information for unit 1, outcome 1, 1.1 as well as a next and previous icon so you can switch between the homepage and the next page for more information on the assignment course work. Page3 contains the information for unit 1, outcome 1, 1.2 and also has a next/previous/home button so you can switch between each page but also press the home button to get back to the home page should you need to.
