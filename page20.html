    <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
    <h2>(Unit 1, Outcome 3, 3.3)</h2>
    <h3>(What would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?)</h3>
    <p>
        What would I do differently? Would I work in a team? I’d say, yes as I think it might make it easier and would be able to get more done in a shorter or similar amount of time as multiple people can work on the same project but working on different parts and we could use something like Slack to keep in contact while we’re busy working on our individual parts plus we could send our finished work to each other over slack in a private group for the project and then we all have a backup copy of all the completed work, plus we could also do various better things for the website project as other people might have other skills they can contribute to the project which would make the website even better and easier for us to actually do some good things together.
