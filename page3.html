    <h2>Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h2>
    <h2>(Unit 1, Outcome 1, 1.2)</h2>
    <p>
    The skills and resources I have used doing the projects I’ve done on this course include learning Javascript, using a resource like Trello to list all the work i’ve needed to do and mark it off as done as and when i’ve managed to finish it, I’ve also used google docs to create word documents for the work i’ve needed to do and share and continue to work on the document i needed to work on with my teammates when we were working together on a project for the course, I’ve also learned how to use a program called Xcode to create an app for an iPhone and other apple devices.
    Similar skills could be used for other digital projects for example building a website you’d need to know HTML and CSS to program it and build it to make it look the way you want for your business or whatever your current project you’re working on is for. Also when working on potential other projects you could also use something like Trello to list your work and mark it off when you’re finished so you know how close you are to completing your project.
