    <h2>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
    <h2>(Unit 1, Outcome 3, 3.2)</h2>
    <p>
        The ways to improve productivity and efficiency are by taking regular breaks, taking a break from looking at the screen for a bit of time so your eyes don’t dry out or start to get too tired, you could also try standing up for a bit to give yourself a break from sitting down for hours on end which would help with keeping active and not spending all your time sitting down, also you could maybe do some yoga to keep physically active so when you’re sitting down for hours on end while working you’ll be ready to get back to work and be more efficient. You could also make sure you eat when you have a break so you’re not hungry while you’re working which can distract you from your work if your stomach is rumbling from hunger. Also ensure that you drink regularly.
