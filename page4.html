    <p>
        To plan making my website I will set up a Trello board and enter all the tasks I need to do for making my website and do them one by one, first I will write out all the written information I need to post on my website, E.g. the units I need to complete to post on the website, then I will use Visual Studio Code to start creating the website using HTML and CSS, while in the process of making my website i will test it to make sure thereâ€™s no problems and ensure it will work properly when finally finished and submitted. So far I have finished most of the tasks I need to do for the actual written work. Today I will try to finish them all and be ready to start setting up my website and learning HTML and CSS later in the day.
