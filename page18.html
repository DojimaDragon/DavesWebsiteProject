    <h3>(Could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?)</h3>
    <p>
        I think I could have been more efficient making my website by using Trello more and organising things better and actually using Visual Studio Code to organise the web pages better than I did and maybe by giving each web page an actual name rather than just for example, page2, page3 and so on like i did, I also think creating the web site in teams may have been more efficient but also more difficult as we would have to share each separate web page we work on with each other using slack or something similar to send the files we’ve done to put them all together to make it work, as far as i’m currently aware there’s no way to work on code such as HTML or CSS together at the exact same time and see each others results in real time rather than having to send each other the files as and when they’re done. Overall i personally think working on the website on our own was a better way of doing it and i think it personally went quite well for myself.
