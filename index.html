<h2>About me!</h2>
<h2>(Unit 1, Outcome 1, 1.0)</h2>
<p>
        My name’s Dave, I’m 34 and from Ellesmere Port, I did two years of IT in college to get onto a two year level three course in Games Development, I’m a big fan of games and love the idea of making them and working on them, in college I did some 3D modelling which I really enjoyed, I’ve always had an interest in coding but I’ve never really taken it up properly as I always struggled trying to learn it when I tried to sit down and do it by myself, I did a HTML course in college that was part time, I learnt quite a lot from it, but that was around 14-15 years ago now and I’ve not really used HTML since college so I’ve basically forgotten it all… 
        <br>
        I was recommended to do codenation by a woman called Jo who I see on a regular bases to try and help me get back into work as I’ve been out of work for over a decade due to mental health issues, I feel like I’m ready to go back to work and we talked about potential jobs and what i’d be interested in doing and she recommended codenation to me, so I decided to do it and here I am! I’m hoping to continue onto the master course, even though I'm concerned about all the travelling and long hours for 3 months… 
        <br>
        It’s been difficult doing it for 3 weeks, doing it for 3 months is a real test of whether I really am truly ready to return to work right now or not, as I feel that I have to try my best to do this otherwise I’ll end up in a job I hate and I’ll never be happy in work.
