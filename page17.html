        According to 2.1 the way I prepared appropriate content for my site was by making a Trello board with all the information I needed and then writing out that content and copying it into Visual Studio Code when it was all finished and organised into the correct format for the website.
        According to 2.2 the way I organised and combined information I needed for my web pages was by typing out the text into a google docs first in order of the assignment and then creating the web page details using using Visual Studio Code and then copying in the assignment work into the represented pages so they arenâ€™t all piled into one web page.
